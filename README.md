The purpose of this repo is to provide a publicly accessible, and maximally thin, script that gets new engineers' machines set up for development at Binti.

The reasoning for why it should be maximally thin is that this repo should get touched minimally, since it'll often be out of sight and out of mind. So really this is here just to get us to a cloned repo and then we let in-repo scripts take it from there.

If you don't work at Binti, this isn't going to help you much, unless you wanna install `brew` and some other stuff, but hey, you're welcome to it if you want. It's kinda-sorta clever how it installs xcode tools?
